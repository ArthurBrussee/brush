Python project to generate reference gradients with gSplat.


To use this, please install `uv`. Then:
- To generate new samples, use `uv run generate_reference.py`.
- To run the benchmarks, use `uv run bench.py`.

The py files can also be used like a notebook in VS Code's interactive window. Just run
the file with uv beforehand so the environment is set up.
